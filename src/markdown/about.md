## Welcome! So glad you're here.

#### A little about me:

I love helping people who wrestle with tough topics of the Christian faith. Often, because I've wrestled with the same topics myself.

I’ve been a pastor for two decades and am the author of a few books. My newest book is [The Party Crasher: How Jesus Disrupts Politics as Usual and Redeems Our Partisan Divide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXJ55PGR?tag=randohouseinc11082-20) (Multnomah, March 2024). The fervency with which so many advocate their political ideals is best described in religious terms. Fortunately, Jesus is the ultimate Party Crasher. And he is disrupting politics-as-usual to invite us to embrace a bold vision capable of redeeming our partisan divide.

I also wrote [Beautiful Union: How God's Vision for Sex Points Us to the Good, Unlocks the True, and (Sort of) Explains Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Union-Unlocks-Explains-Everything/dp/0593445031/ref=sr_1_1) (Multnomah, April 2023). It’s a powerful call for Christians to understand sex as a window into God’s story of redemption, and a validating guide to living with authentic love in a changing culture.

My first book, [The Skeletons in God’s Closet: The Mercy of Hell, the Surprise of Judgment, the Hope of Holy War](https://www.amazon.com/Skeletons-Gods-Closet-Surprise-Judgment/dp/0529100819/ref=sr_1_2) (Thomas Nelson, 2014) was a finalist for the Evangelical Christian Publisher Association’s “New Author of the Year” award in 2015, was ranked “Best Popular Theological Book of 2014” by Christianity Today contributor Andrew Wilson, was included in The Gospel Coalition’s “Most Important Books for Pastors from the 2010s,” and received rave reviews from voices across the theological spectrum. My second book, [The Pursuing God: A Reckless, Irrational, Obsessed Love That’s Dying to Bring Us Home](https://www.amazon.com/Pursuing-God-Reckless-Irrational-Obsessed/dp/0718021606/ref=sr_1_1) (Thomas Nelson, 2016) was similarly praised from a diverse chorus of voices.

Whether in sermons, books, or speaking, I have a reputation for “paradigm shifts,” that help people who struggle with the toughest topics of the Christian faith to fall deeper in love with Jesus, gain fresh confidence in the authority of the Bible, and grow in trusting the goodness of God.

I love hiking, taco crawls, and playing guitar. Together with my wife Holly, daughter Aiden, and sons James and Jacob, we enjoy spending time with good friends over great meals, and exploring the scenic beauty of the Southwest.

A few weird facts about me:

- I once got beat up by a billy goat.
- I've been run over by a VW van.
- I ate a dog (don't worry, it was cooked).
