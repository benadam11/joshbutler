## Welcome! So glad you're here. 

#### A little about me:

I love Jesus and I love paradigm-shifting: confronting popular caricatures of the Christian faith and replacing them with the beauty and power of the real thing. My goal is to help people who wrestle with these tough topics. Often, I’ve wrestled with the same topics myself.

I currently serve as a lead pastor of [Redemption Tempe](#), a thriving church near Arizona State University, one of the largest colleges in the country. I’ve also written a few critically acclaimed books and am a fellow with The Keller Center for Cultural Apologetics. Prior to 2018, I served as an outreach pastor for fifteen years at Imago Dei Community in Portland (OR).  

My newest book is [Beautiful Union: How God’s Vision for Sex Points Us to the Good, Unlocks the True, and (Sort of) Explains Everything (Waterbrook/Multnomah, April 2023)](#). It’s a powerful call for Christians to understand sex as a window into God's story of redemption, and to live faithfully as a reflection of God's extravagant love. I’m so excited, I've been working on this project for over 5 years and hope it's a resource to help equip the church in this important area.

Prior to that, my first book, [The Skeletons in God’s Closet: The Mercy of Hell](#), the Surprise of Judgment, the Hope of Holy War (Thomas Nelson, 2014) was a finalist for the Evangelical Christian Publisher Association’s “New Author of the Year” award in 2015, was ranked “Best Popular Theological Book of 2014” by Christianity Today contributor Andrew Wilson, was included in The Gospel Coalition’s “Most Important Books for Pastors from the 2010s,” and received rave reviews from voices across the theological spectrum. My second book, The Pursuing God: A Reckless, Irrational, Obsessed Love That’s Dying to Bring Us Home (Thomas Nelson, 2016) was similarly praised from a diverse chorus of voices.

My wife Holly and I have been married since 2006, and have three beautiful children: our daughter Aiden, and sons James and Jacob. We enjoy spending time with good friends over great meals, and exploring the scenic beauty of the Southwest. In my spare time, I like hiking and playing guitar.

#### A few weird facts about me:
- I once got beat up by a billy goat.
- I've been run over by a VW van.
- I ate a dog (don't worry, it was cooked).

I hope you enjoy the site! Make yourself at home, stay as long as you like, help yourself to anything in the fridge . . . and message me on Instagram or Twitter if you enjoyed your stay!
